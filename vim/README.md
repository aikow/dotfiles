# Vim

The vim configuration is located in another GitHub repository, which can be
found [here](https://github.com/SupremeCommandaPanda/vim).

Simply clone the repository to either `~/.config/nvim` for Neovim.
For Vim, clone the repository to `~/.config/nvim` and then create a symbolic link 

```
ln -s ~/.config/nvim/init.vim ~/.vimrc
```
