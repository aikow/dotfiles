## Highlights

I generally try to adhere to the following conventions for highlights

| highlight | description                  |
| --------- | ---------------------------- |
| a         | approach                     |
| c         | a "con" or a downside        |
| d         | definitions                  |
| e         | experiment setup             |
| h         | anything important           |
| i         | implementation details       |
| o         | citation to an *o*ther paper |
| p         | a "pro" or an upside         |
| r         | experiment results           |
