# Insync

Insync is a tool to synchronize GoogleDrive or OneDrive cloud storage accounts
with your local machine.

Since it doesn't allow for account-wide ignore rules, you'll have to add the
ignore rules every time you set up a instance on a new machine.
Simply copy the contents of the [./ignore](ignore file) (with `gitignore`
syntax) into the ignore rules inside the app.
